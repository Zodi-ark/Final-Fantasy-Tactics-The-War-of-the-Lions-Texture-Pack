# Version List

### `v1.0`
- ~90% of all UI Elements have been altered.  
  - The new textures where created from a variety of sources: mobile port, redrawn by hand, redrawn by AI, or upscaled by AI.
- Most sword skills have been given an HDR makeover.
- At this point too much to list or even remember.

# Changing from Euro to US (Experimental)

Changed the folders name from `ULES00850` to `ULUS10297`

# Know Issues

-Win condition overlay sometimes does not display new texture

-Texture pack for ULUS10297- US region not tested (won't be surprised if theres bugs)
